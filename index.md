# Hi from Shahzad

## Advent of Code 2021

Giving it a try this year. Started late so had to catch up first.

### Days 1 to 8

Gotta catch up ...!

My answers are not in the style of the top ranked players - ðŸ‘´ðŸ˜‚

### Day 9

Finally caught up. A relatively simple one after my Day 8 epic!

### Day 10

Quite simple, but got caught out in part 2 by not using **longs** and getting negative values which meant I gave the wrong answer.

### Days 12 - 17 Delayed by building an awesome **fence** - ðŸ¤º not that kind!

### Day 17 - Resume Day 12
